# Prime Number Multiplication Table

The task:

>Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of 
(N) prime numbers.

This React app is run by:
* npm install
* npm start

The user is then able to either type in the length of the grid or use the buttons to select a size. There will be an output listing the first N numbers and the table will be generated. 

I believe the structure of the code is straightforward and it allows for a different prime generator to be substituted. I personally am quite happy with my own generator, I believe there will be a more mathematically correct way to create one however I believe my way works well for the task. I dislike the current output format, if I have more time I will make it search each entry and make sure it's X characters so that the output comes out in a nicer grid. Currently the grid starts to go out of line as the generated numbers become higher.
